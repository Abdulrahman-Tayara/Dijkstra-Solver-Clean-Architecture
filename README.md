# Dijkstra Solver
Dijkstra Solver is Android App for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph stands on Dijkstra Algorithm.

# App Architectures
This app is built on Clean-Architecture principles with MVVM design patterns.

The architectures was implemented using RxJava2.


This is the Clean-Architecture layers and how the layers communicate between each others:
